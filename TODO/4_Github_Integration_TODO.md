# To-Do list for the integration the BlueDrop Analysis Library with Github

## Documentation

Integration has been started. What needs to be done now is debugging. The generation of the docs on `readthedocs`.

1) Figure out why the readthedocs isn't loading all of the documentation. Something is probably wrong with the `rst` files. 


## Automatic testing
1) Look into how to set up the repo so that it can run tests locally
2) Look how to integrate automatic testing with GitHub
3) Integrate automatic testing with GitHub

## Github project
1) Look into how to integrate this todo list into github projects. Not sure if it's worth using it but should try just to learn how it works and when to apply it.
