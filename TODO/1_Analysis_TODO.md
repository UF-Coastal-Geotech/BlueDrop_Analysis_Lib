# To-Do list for the BlueDrop Analysis Library - Analysis side

## Documentation that needs to be written
This includes adding paper references for the equations. There needs to be a link between the function and the work that it came from. There needs to be a significant effort to get the source from the original source and confirm that the equation is actually in the original source. Ideally there should be a reference to a page in the reference and an equation number.

## Things that need to be collected
1) Need the code that generated the random forest prior model
2) Other functions that are/should be used by the group
    * Work about the pressure correction that needs to be done to the PFFP pressure module
    * Work that has been done by other students that is related
3) Equation for rope drag as a function of depth
4) Rope friction factor
   * This will depend on the rope but if we can get something in the ballpark that's a first step
 
5) Drag factor for the pffp 
    * This is going to depend on the tip type

## Code that needs to be written
1) Function to calc rope drag at current depth
2) Reference (.csv, excel, JSON, etc.) that contians the value for the rope drag as a function of rope type

## Code that needs to be reorganized
1) PffpFile Class is to messy especially the code that checks if there's a drop in the file
2) PffpFolder could also use some work
