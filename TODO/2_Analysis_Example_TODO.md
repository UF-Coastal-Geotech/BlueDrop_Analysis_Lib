# Examples that need to be done
These are going to be Jupyter notebooks that show examples of using the functions

This will play the role of:
1) Showing future users how to use the code
2) being a global test to make sure the values generated by the code are reasonable
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Basic data loading and plotting

### Water Drop
Should show:
1) Loading in binary files
2) Selecting the pffp id and calibration factors
3) Analyzing the files for drops
4) Generating the deceleration plots

### Air Drops
Should show:
1) loading in binary files
2) selecting the pffp id and calibration factors
3) Analyzing the drops
4) Generating the deceleration plots
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Manual Drop Processing
1) Should show using the manual drop selection feature
2) Plot the resulting data including a drop that was processed automatically and one that was processed manually

## Plotting bearing capacity data

### Normal strain rate factor (This should be done for clays)
1) Load in the drops
2) Set the pffp cone configuration
3) Generate the dynamic bearing capacity
4) Generate the quasi-static bearing capacity

### White bearing capacity (This should be done for sands)
1) Load in the drops
2) Set the pffp cone configuration
3) Generate the dynamic bearing capacity
4) Generate the quasi-static bearing capacity
